# Mobile-Earth-Scientist

A very rudimentary iOS app for viewing [NASA GIBS](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/gibs) imagery.

Created for a mobile app development class at Syracuse University: the app development was focused more on demonstrating knowledge of iOS development concepts than the actual usefulness of the app itself.

Also features a map layer sharing feature using Google Firebase.
