# Mobile-Earth-Scientist

A very rudimentary iOS app for viewing [NASA GIBS](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/gibs) imagery.

Created for a mobile app development class at Syracuse University: the app development was focused more on demonstrating knowledge of iOS development concepts than the actual usefulness of the app itself. Uses Google Maps for the base upon which the GIBS imagery is overlayed.

Also features a custom map layer group sharing feature using Google Firebase.
